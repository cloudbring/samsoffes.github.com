title: Cocoa Makes It Easy

So today I was wondering how to get the user's time zone on the iPhone. So I googled it up. I found a [forum thread](http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/13234-how-get-time-zone.html) that said look at `NSTimeZone`. Easy enough.

All I had to do was `[NSTimeZone localTimeZone]`. Awesome. I love Cocoa.
