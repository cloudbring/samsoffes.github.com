This is my blog. You can read it at <http://samsoff.es>.

It's running on [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) (blog-aware, static site generator) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).

I used a lot of ideas from [Tom Preston-Werner](http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com), [Tom Ward](http://github.com/tomafro/tomafro.net), and [Alex Payne](http://github.com/al3x/al3x.github.com).

Feel free to use anything here except my posts without asking.
